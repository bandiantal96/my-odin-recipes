    <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This omelet is so easy and delicious. It bakes in the oven, so there is no watching the stove. My son loves to make it for us.</p>

    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Directions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>In a blender, combine eggs, milk, flour, salt and pepper; cover and process until smooth. Pour into prepared baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until set, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese.</li>
        <li>Carefully loosen edges of omelet from pan. Starting from the short edge of the pan, carefully roll up omelet. Place omelet seam side down on a serving plate and cut into 6 equal sized pieces.</li>
    </ol>
